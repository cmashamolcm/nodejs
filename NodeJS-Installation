1.) Download from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2.) Install
3.) Command prompt
      node -v //-> v12.18.0
4.) Create a simple .js file -> MyFirstJS.js -> console.log("Hai");
5.) node MyFirstJS.js will run the script
6.) To enter into node cmd, 
          open cmd
          type node
          type any js command. Eg: console.log("hello");
          // will print 
          hello
          undefined<in grey color>
7.) In Windows, Node JS cmd comes with installation. But sometimes shows error 
800A1391 'console' is undefined
etc. This is beacause, Windows try to run .js files/ scripts with Microsoft Scripting Engine by default whereas we need to run it via Chrome v8 engine.
When does node <filename>.js, it enables to run program in v8 engine.
