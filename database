1.) Parsing input from request body:
    Use body-parser package.
    Note: jsonp - json with passing. Earlier it was used for cross domain restrictions. abc.com cannot directly access xyz.com. ow we use cors instead.
    Earlier, jsonp was used. It have <script> tag and inside that a src arg which have a callback method also. So, when gets invoked, js sends to other domain, 
    get response and process inside callback method and show the result.
    const parser = require('body-parser');
    app.use(parser.json()); - will do the trick.
    app.use(parser.urlencoded({extended: false})); - to accesss data coming along with url. Eg: /hello?name=asha
