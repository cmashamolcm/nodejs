1.) Session ID: (Relate it as a membdership id in an organization)
    A unique id defined from the web server in return of successful authentication of user credentials.
    Session ID will be specific to the website and can be decoded only by that web server. They are randomly generated over a time period.
2.) Cookie: (Relate it as the physical ID Card whic holds membership id.)
    Session ID is stored within a wrapper called cookie which can hold additional information as well. This will be send to client
    browser and browser can store the cookies to reuse it when further communication happens with the web server instead of authenticate
    by user credentials every time.
3.) cookie based authentication:
    Validation of cookies from client at server side to enable authorized access is called cookie based authentication.
    Login requests creates session id and returns cookie to client from server side.
    Logout removes the session ID from database as well as cookie from server side. 
    As a response to logout call, server asks browser/ client to clear the cookies from local cache/ file system as well as part of complete logout.
    Cookies are not much trust worthy.
4.) Token based Authentication:
    Using OAuth, JWT etc.
    It is go grant access to a subset of resources/ data. Not for the entire data.
    Eg: For one time payment of bill via net banking, token can be used. But it won't grant permission to access full bank account details.
    Advantage is we can invalidate the token and revoke the access anytime.
    Token have an expiry and it gets refreshed on expiry, if we still use the valid token.
    Token can hold permissions/ grants, session information etc. Eg: JWT token can have session info as well.
5.) Usecase for Token vs Cookies:
    Cookies use with browsers as its handled as special entities in response header in browser.
    Tokens are best to use if apps are used to interact with web server as it don't have any special treatment capabilities for cookies.
6.) Express-Session middleware:
    Till 3.x, it was part of express. Now its an independent module.
    npm install --save express-session
    
    const express = require('express');
    const session = require('express-session');

    const session_route = express.Router('/');
    module.exports = session_route;
    session_route.use(session({secret: 'shhhhhh', saveUninitialized: false, resave: true, cookie: {secure: false, data:'abc'}}));
    // if secure == true, only https will enable cookies. For http calls, it won't be enables.
    //Set-Cookie: connect.sid=s%3AxiASMrLoHfOaaBEWM4bXGbgpxxxiqXEBcSy.fY%2FdSuPAdoqfZLGwMxHfUhCrDoDM3tyiY5ccx9EV2e7dEc; Path=/; HttpOnly will not be visible in that case
    // added the session to express route in above line
    session_route.get('/login/:uid', (req, res, next)=>{
    console.log(req.params);
    var sessionJson = req.session;// the session object from request is used here
    if(req.params.uid == '123'){
        sessionJson.data = 'unique_id_admin';// added a key value; {data: 'unique_is_admin'} into session object
        res.end('validated session');
    }else{
        next(new Error('Unauthorised user'));
    }
    });

    session_route.get('/act', (req, res, next)=>{// uses the session created in login time.
    console.log(req.session);// prints Session object as: { cookie: {path: '/', _expires: null, originalMaxAge: null, httpOnly: true, secure: false}}
    if(req.session.data == 'unique_id_admin'){ // allowes only if session have the data value
        res.end('validated session - so user activity allowed');
    }else{
        res.status(401);
        throw new Error('Unauthorised user - no activity allowed');
    }
    });

    session_route.get('/logout', (req, res, next)=>{// destroy the session. It clears the session and afterwards, if we try /act, 401 error comes.
    console.log(req.session);
    req.session.destroy((err)=>{
        console.log('An error cooured while clearing the session');
    });
    res.end('destroyed session to logout');
    });
