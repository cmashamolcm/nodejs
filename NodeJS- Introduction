1.) What?
Open source, cross platform
Java Script framework for server side web app developement.
Developed on top of Chrome v8 js engine
Helps to directly compile JS into machine code
Its event driven and nonblocking IO to scale

Note:
server side web app developement:
 Using scripting languages in server side itself to give customized response for the clients.
 Eg: Give custom static web pages to a client from server using scripting languages.
 

2.) Why?
Multithreaded applications faces resource conjuction, cost for scaling etc.
In such case, single threaded application is good, but it have less performance.
NodeJS is based on even loop, event queues and single thread backed with multiple thread pools to over come such issues.

3.) Multi threaded                                               -     Single threaded
    1-Multiple requests get blocked by listener cum worker       -     1-Only one thread called event loop to handle multiple requests
    thread
    
    2-Incoming request direct processing model                   -     2-Queuing and processing model
    
    3-Many context switching                                     -     3-Not much frequent context switching
    
    4-Sync way of doing                                          -     4-Async way of doing (callback etc)

Well suited for distributed systems with huge no: if requests to process
It can manage the problem of allocating same resouce to multiple threads/ request came in
