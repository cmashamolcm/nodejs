1.) What?
Open source, cross platform
Java Script framework for server side web app developement.
Developed on top of Chrome v8 js engine
Helps to directly compile JS into machine code
Its event driven and nonblocking IO to scale

Note:
server side web app developement:
 Using scripting languages in server side itself to give customized response for the clients.
 Eg: Give custom static web pages to a client from server using scripting languages.
 

2.) Why?
Multithreaded applications faces resource conjuction, cost for scaling etc.
In such case, single threaded application is good, but it have less performance.
NodeJS is based on even loop, event queues and single thread backed with multiple thread pools to over come such issues.

3.) Multi threaded                                               -     Single threaded
    1-Multiple requests get blocked by listener cum worker       -     1-Only one thread called event loop to handle multiple requests
    thread
    
    2-Incoming request direct processing model                   -     2-Queuing and processing model
    
    3-Many context switching                                     -     3-Not much frequent context switching
    
    4-Sync way of doing                                          -     4-Async way of doing (callback etc)

Well suited for distributed systems with huge no: if requests to process
It can manage the problem of allocating same resouce to multiple threads/ request came in

3.) Prominent users?
Netflix, LinkedIn, Uber, ebay, PayPal

4.) Features:
    Async & Event driven
    All nodejs APIs are non-blocking/ async ie; not waiting for 
    request -> caller    -----request-------->  recepient
                         <----response--------  
                                  /<- callback
                                  
    1.) Very fast due to Chrome v8
    2.) Highly scalable due to even driven even after single threading
    3.) No buffering, deliver in chucks
5.) Variable Scopes:
    Global - in all files available
           - Eg: __dirname, __filename
           - timer construct - setTimeout(callback, delay) ; setInterval(callback, delay); setImmediate(callback, args)
    vs 
    Local - in single .js file
6.) Callback:
    Can be considered as async equivalent of a funcation. It will get executed after a particular task is complete.
    Eg: fs.readFile(fname, (err, data)->{});//callback executes after file read
7.) Events:
    Node JS is event driven
    e = require("events"); - import event module
    emitter = new e.EventEmitter(); - create emitter object
    emitter.emit('event-name'); - emit event
    emitter.on('event-name', ()->{}); - register listener and here, callback is event handler
8.) HTTP:
    Uses http module.
    Creates a node server in specified port.
    Can be server or client
    Server:
    -------
    var http = require('http');
    http.createServer().listen(1000); -> enough to start a server. But localhost:1000 will just show as loading because the response stream is not closed.
    Then;
    http.createServer((req, resp)=>{resp.end()}).listen(1000); -> this won't work until there is a write happens to stream
    Then;
    http.createServer((req, resp)=>{resp.write("something"); resp.end();}).listen(1000); -> noew works fine.
    
    Client:
    -------
    const http = require('http');
    http.request("http://localhost:1000", (resp)=>{//resp event
     resp.on('data', (chunk)=>{
      console.log(chunk.toString()); -> if not given toString(), will print byte array ie; buffer
     });
    }).end(); -> if end() is not given, stream will not be closed and hence no it happens to server at 1000. Even console logging given in server didn't work
    
    Server Side with Http Verbs:
    ----------------------------
    var http = require('http');
    http.createServer((req, resp)=>{
    if(req.url == '/test' && req.method == 'GET'){
     resp.write('Hello Kitty');
    }else if(req.method == 'POST'){
     resp.write('Sending a message....');
    }
    resp.end();
    }).listen(2000);
    
    Client Sending POST Req:
    ------------------------
    var http = require('http');
    var options = {"method": "POST", "path" : "http://localhost:2000"};
    http.request(options, (resp)=>{
     resp.on('data', (chunk)=>{
      console.log(chunk);
     });
    }).end();
